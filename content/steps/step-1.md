## How does this workshop work?

This workshop is about learning something new that helps you to explore new interests and provide basic knowledge to continue learning.
What's important in that regard?

- Keep an open mind
- Be patient
- Help each other out
- Ask the mentors questions!
- Celebrate your successes today

Feel free to pair with one or two other people in the group. If you prefer working on your own, this is also great - see whatever works best for you!
